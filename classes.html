                Yoga is a mind–body practice that combines physical postures,
                breathing techniques, and meditation to promote overall health, 
                flexibility, strength, and inner calm. Originating in ancient India, 
                it focuses on harmonizing the body, mind, and spirit, helping reduce stress 
                and improve well-being.

                HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) is a workout method that 
                alternates short bursts of intense exercise with brief recovery periods. 
                It’s designed to burn more calories in less time, boost cardiovascular fitness,
                and improve endurance.

                Zumba is a fun, high-energy fitness program that combines 
                dance and aerobic movements to upbeat music, often inspired 
                by Latin and international rhythms. It helps improve cardiovascular 
                health, coordination, and overall fitness while making exercise feel like a 
                party.

                Strength training is a form of exercise that uses resistance—like 
                weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight—to build muscle strength, 
                endurance, and tone. It helps improve overall fitness, boost metabolism, 
                and support bone and joint health.
